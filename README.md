### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**BlueGamesplayer/BlueGamesplayer** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on nothing
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with Mikey, a.k.a Isigebengu-mikey
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with my Python study
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: DM me on Discord at: BlueGamesplayer#4773
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm just a really boring guy. Yeah, that's all about me
